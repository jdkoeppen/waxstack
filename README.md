"A Painfully Manual Music Database"

Waxstack is a simple database app in which a user can store a collection of music albums. The user must create an account to establish a collection, and will have the options to add, edit or delete albums from the collection.

## Getting Started

To view the app as a guest, enter username "demoUser" and password "password01" to login. The user will be presented with a default collection table. Each row can be clicked to show the details for the album selected. Within this modal a user can choose to Edit or Delete the selected album. 

Above the collection table, by clicking the Add Record button, the user can create a new entry in the collection. (ability to add custom album art is planned for future releases)

## Locations
